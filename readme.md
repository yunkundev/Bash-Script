# Shell Scripting

## 1, Shell Scripting Basic 

### 1.1, Shebang

**Script.sh:**

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Scripting is fun!"
```

`#!(Shebang)` tell which interpreter will be used by script. 

1. sh(Bourne Shell): basic Unix shell.

2. bash(Bourne Again Shell): LinuxOS defalt. It include some new future such as command completion, command edit and history.

3. csh: Another Shell Scripting, its' grammmar very similiar with C program.

4. tcsh: A tpye of C shell offered by Linux operation.

5. ksh: A combined of C Shell and Bourne Shell

6. pdksh: A tpye of ksh offered by Linux operation.

### 1.2, sleep shell

**Sleepy.sh:**


```
#!/bin/bash
sleep 90
```
We run this script:

```
./sleepy.sh &
```

The & makes the command run in the background.

Linux: 

* sleep:  sleep for a specified number of second

* ps -fp: select specific processes using the ps command 

If a script does not contain a shebang the commands are executed using your shell

### 1.3, More than just shell script


**hi.py:**

```
#! /usr/bin/python
print "This is a Python script."
```

### 1.4 Vairiables

>Syntax:
>
> VARIABLE_NAME = "Value"

Vairables are case sensitive.

 By converntion variables are **uppercase**.
 
 * Variable Usage:
 
 ```
 #!/bin/bash
 MY_SHELL = "bash"
 echo "I like the $MY_SHELL shell."
 ```
 
 
 ```
 #!/bin/bash
 MY_SHELL = "bash"
 echo "I am ${MY_SHELL}ing on my keyboard."
 ```
 
 * Assign command output to a variable:
 
 ```
 #!/bin/bash
 SERVER_NAME = $(hostname)
 echo "You are running this script on ${SERVER_NAME}."
 ```

### 1.5 Tests

> Syntax:
> 
> [Condition-to-test-for]


**File operators(tests):**

* -d FILE:   True if file is a directory.
* -e FILE:   True if file exists.
* -f FILE:   True if file exists and is a regular file.
* -r FILE:   True if file is readable by you.
* -s FILE:   True if file exists and is not empty.
* -w FILE:   True if the file is writable by you.
* -x FILE:   True if the file is executable by yoou.

**String operators(tests):**

* -z FILE:   				True if string is empty.
* -n FILE:   				True if string is not empty.
* STRING1 = STRING2 	True if the strings are equal
* STRING1 != STRING2 	True if the strings are not equal

**Arithmetic operators(tests)**

* arg1 -eq arg2 		True if arg1 is equal to arg2
* arg1 -ne arg2		True if arg1 is not equal to arg2
* arg1 -lt arg2		True if arg1 is less than arg2
* arg1 -le arg2		True if arg1 is less than or equal to arg2
* arg1 -gt arg2		True if arg1 is greater than arg2
* arg1 -ge arg2		True if arg1 is greater than or equal to arg2

### 1.6 The if statement


>if [condition-is-true]
>
>then ...
>
>elif [condition-is-true]
>
>then ...
>
>else ...
>
>fi


### 1.7 For Loop

> for VARIABLE_NAME int ITEM_1 ... ITEM_N
> 
> do ...
> 
> done

**rename_pics.sh:**

```
#!/bin/bash
PICTURES=$(ls *jpg)
DATE=$(date +%F)

for PICTURE in $PICTURES
do 
	echo "Renaming ${PICTURE} to ${DATE}-${PICTURE}"
	mv ${PICTURE} ${DATE}-${PICTURE}
done
```

**Do not leave space before or behind the equal signal!**


### 1.8 Positional Parameters

> script.sh parameter1 parameter2 parameter3

$0: "script.sh"

$1: "parameter1"

$2: "parameter2"

$3: "parameter3"


**lock_user.sh:**

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Eexecuting script: $0"
for USER in $@
do 
	echo "Archiving user: $USER"
	#Lock the account
	passwd -l $USER
	#Create an archive of the home directory
	tar cf /archives/${USER}.tar.gz /home/${USER}
done
```

### 1.9 Accepting User Input(STDIN)

>Syntax:
>
>	read -p "PROMPT" VARIABLE


**stdin.sh**

```
read -p "Enter a user name: " USER
echo "Archiveing user: $USER" 
```

## 2, Exit statuses and Return Codes

### 2.1 Return Code

Every command returns an exit status

Range from 0 to 255, 0 = success, other = error

**pingGoogle**

```
#!/bin/bash
MY_HOST="google.com"
ping -c 1 $MY_HOST
if [ "$?" -eq "0" ]
then
	echo "${MY_HOST} reachable"
else
  	echo "${MY_HOST} unreachable"
fi

```


$? contains the return code of the previously executed command.

* **&&(and)**: only if the first one is true we run second one.
* **||(or)**: only if the first one is false we run second one.
* **;(semicolon)**: ensure they all get executed

### 2.2 Exit Command

Explicitly define the return code 1-255

The default value is that the last command executed: exit 0

```
ping -c 1 -w 1 amazon.com 
echo $? #1 
ping -c 1 amazon.com.blah
echo $? #2
man ping # look forward what exit command for
```

## 3, Functions

### 3.1 Define function

**DRY**: donot repeat yourself

```
function function-name(){
	# Code goes here.
}
 
# Call the function
function-name
```

Execute from top to the buttom, no precompiled

Variables have to be defined before used

* **By default, variables are global**
* **WE can use local to create local varible**

### 3.2 Positional Parameters

* $0: the script itselft
* $1, $2 ...:parameters
* $@: all of the parameters


```
#!/bin/bash
function hello(){
	for NAME in $@
	do 
		echo "Hello $NAME"
	done
}
hello Jason Dan Ryan 
```
 
### 3.3 Exit Status(Return Codes)

* Explicitly: return <RETURN_CODE>
* Implicity: The exit status of the last command executed in the function

```
#!/bin/bash
function backup_file()
{
	if [ -f $1 ]
	then
		local BACK="/tmp/$(basename ${1}).$(date +%F).$$"
		echo "Backing up $1 to ${BACK}"
		cp $1 $BACK
	else
		return 1
		fi
}

backup_file /etc/hosts
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
	echo "Backup succeeded!"
else
	echo "Backup failed!"
	exit 1
fi
```

## 4, Wildcards

### 4.1 Wildcard Introduction

Globbing expands the wildcard pattern into a list of files and/or directories.

Wildcards can be used with most commands:

* ls
* rm
* cp

**Wildcard**

1. * - matches zero or more character
2. ? - matches exactly one character
3. [] - A character class: matche any of the characters included  between the brackets. Matches exactly one character.
4. [!] - Matches any of the characters NOT included between the brackets.
5.  \ escapes character. Use if you want to match a wildcase character.


Named Character Classes

* [[:alpha:]] : alpha
* [[:alnum:]] : alpha + digit
* [[:digit:]] : digit
* [[:lower:]] : lower case
* [[:space:]] : widcaese
* [[:upper:]] : upper case

### 4.2 Wildcard in Shell Script

Wildcards are great when you want to work on a group of files or directories. **Just like a regular command line.**


```
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www
cp *.html /var/www-just-html
```
In a for loop

```
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www
for FILE in *.html
do 
	echo "Copying $FILE"
	cp $FILE /var/www-just-html
done vv
```

Supply a directory in the wildcard or use the cd command to change the current directory.

## 5ï¼ŒOthers

### 5.1 Case statements

```
case "$VAR" in
	pattern_1)
		# Commands go here.
		;;
	pattern_N)
		# Commands go here.
		;;
esac
```

Example:

```
case "$1" in
	start | START)
		/usr/sbin/sshd
		;;
	stop | STOP)
		kill $(cat /var/run/sshd.pid)
		;;
	*)
		echo "Usage: $0 start|stop"; exit 1
		;;
esac
```

```
read -p "Enter y or n: " ANSWER
case "$ANSWER" in
	[yY]|[yY][eE][sS])
		echo "You answered yes."
		;;
	[nN]|[nN][oO])
		echo "You answered no"
		;;
	*)
		echo "Invaild answer."
		;; 
esac
```


### 5.2 Logging

Logs are the who, what, when, where, and why

The syslog standard uses facilities and serverities to caegorize messages.

* Facilities: kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, local0, local7
* Serverities: emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug

Log file locations are configurable:

* /var/log/messages
* /var/log/syslog

**logging with logger**

```
$logger "Message"
Aug 2 01:22:34 linuxsvr jason: Message
$logger -p local0.infor "Message"
Aug 2 01:22:41 linuxsvr jason:Message 

```

### 5.3 While Loops
 
```
INDEX = 1
while [ $INDEX -lt 6 ]
do 
	echo "Creating project-${INDEX}"
	mkdir /usr/local/project-${INDEX}
	((INDEX++))
done
```
Reading a file, line-by-line

```
LINE_NUM = 1
while read LINE
do 
	echo "${LINE_NUM}: ${LINE}"
	((LINE_NUM++))
done < /etc/fstab
```
**break** and **continue**

### 5.4 Debugging

* A bug is really an error
* -x = Prints commands as they execute
* #!/bin/bash -x
* set -x to debug set +x to stop debugging

```
#!/bin/bash
TEST_VAR = "test"
set -x
echo $TEST_VAR
set +x
hostname
```

**Built in Debugging Help**

* -e = Exit on error ```#!/bin/bash -ex```
* -v = Prints shell input lines as they are read.
